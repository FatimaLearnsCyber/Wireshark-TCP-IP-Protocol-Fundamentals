# Wireshark TCP/IP Protocol Fundamentals

This repository contains my hands-on guided project from Coursera titled **"Wireshark for Beginners: TCP/IP Protocol Fundamentals"**. The project focused on capturing and analyzing TCP/IP traffic to understand how data travels through a network.

# Project Tasks

### Task 1: Capture TCP/IP Traffic
- Used Wireshark to capture packets on the Ethernet interface (`ensX`)
- Saved packet captures to `.pcap` files

### Task 2: Internet Layer Analysis
- Used display filters like `tcp.port == 80` and `ip.addr == x.x.x.x` to analyze HTTP traffic
- Used `ping` to observe ICMP and resolve host IP addresses

### Task 3: TCP Three-Way Handshake
- Observed the SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets that form the TCP handshake
- Verified proper connection setup using sequence and acknowledgment numbers

### Task 4: HTTP Transactions
- Observed GET requests and server responses (HTML/Text)
- Understood how TCP/IP manages reliable communication

### Task 5: HTTPS Transactions
- Observed TLS Handshakes including `Client Hello`
- Verified secure communication via encryption keys

##  Key Skills

- Network Packet Analysis
- TCP/IP Protocols
- HTTP vs HTTPS Traffic
- Wireshark Display Filters
- TLS Handshake
- Packet Capture (`.pcap`)
